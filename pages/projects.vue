          In a university course we were building real applications with real customers. I was managing a team, by side
          of programming and planning work, that was building an App for Weinmann Emergency. The App should improve the
          information flow of patient data and life signs on the way from the emergency side to the hospital.

          With the medical exercises in EU-Modex-Cycles (EU Civil Protection) getting bigger and bigger the patient and
          medical inject planning can't be done by pen and paper anymore. Therefore I have written a planning tool. The
          system was battle tested multiple times in some of the worlds biggest medical exercises. I hopefully will be
          able to release the software under open source license soon on Github. Also, the development will be ongoing.
