            I'm currently working at a consulting company for housing companies.
            In my position as a full-stack developer, I'm planning and
            developing different big data and analytical applications.

            In a university course, we were building real applications with real
            customers. I was managing a team, by the side of programming and
            planning work, that was creating an App for Weinmann Emergency. The
            App should improve the information flow of patient data and life
            signs on the way from the emergency side to the hospital.

            With the medical exercises in EU-Modex-Cycles (EU Civil Protection)
            getting bigger and bigger the patient and medical inject planning
            can't be done by pen and paper anymore. Therefore I have written a
            planning tool. The system was battle-tested multiple times in some
            of the worlds biggest medical exercises. I hopefully will be able to
            release the software under open source license soon on Github. Also,
            development is ongoing.
